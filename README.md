# Hi-Tech Rhapsody

Is this the real life?  
Is this just fantasy?  
Caught in a landslide,  
Press escape for reality.  
  
Open your eyes,  
Look up to the skies and see,  
I'm just a poor intern, I need no sympathy,  
Because I'm easy come, easy go,  
Little high, little low,  
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.  
  
Mama, just committed a bug,  
Pull request against my branch,  
Pushed to master, now it’s done.  
Mama, I just got this job.  
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.  
  
Mama, ooh,  
Didn't mean to make this bug,  
If its not fixed this time tomorrow,  
I'll Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.  
  
Too late, they found my bug,  
Sitting on this chair so much,  
Body's aching all the time.  
Goodbye, everybody, I've fucked this up,  
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.  
  
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows),  
I really need a job,  
I sometimes wish I'd never learned CS at all.  
  
I see a little silhouetto of a man,  
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?  
Doxygen and writing,  
Very, very frightening me.  
(Galileo) Galileo.  
(Galileo) Galileo,  
Galileo Figaro  
Magnifico-o-o-o-o.  
  
I'm just a poor intern, QA doesnt loves me.  
He's just a poor intern from a bankrupt company,  
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.  
  
Easy come, easy go, will you let it go?  
Bismillah! No, we will not let it go. (Let it go!)  
Bismillah! We will not let it go. (Let it go!)  
Bismillah! We will not let it go. (Let it go!)  
Will not let it go. (Let it go!)  
Never let it go (Never, never, never, never let it go)  
Oh oh oh oh  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let it go.)  
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.  
  
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?  
So you think you can love me and leave me to debug?  
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,  
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.  
  
(Ooooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)  
  
Nothing really matters,  
Anyone can see,  
Nothing really matters,  
Nothing really matters to me.  
  
Any way the wind blows.
